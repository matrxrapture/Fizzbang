Fizz buzz
---------
Fizz buzz (also known as bizz buzz, or simply buzz) is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

How it works
------------
Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. 
However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. 

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:

1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 
31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, etc.

What is expected from the application
-------------------------------------
Write an application to simulate the game described above. Let the application count up to 100. There is only a single player counting to themselves.

The expected outcome should be the same as the example given in the How it works section
